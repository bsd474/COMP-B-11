# Java - Project #2 Double Number

42.2 Programming Project #01B
Auto-graded programming assignments have numerous advantages, but have some challenges too. In order for auto-grading to work, sometimes the output needs to be formatted is a narrow and specific manner. For example, if you write a program to prompt the user to enter information as in the following, you do not need to output the 5.

- Enter x: 
- 5
- x doubled is: 10

The program should only output as follows:

- Enter x: 
- x doubled is: 10


Whitespace matters, an extra space can be a problem.

* Be careful using print() vs. println().

For programs like this, be sure to use the input window to enter values. Look for the box that shows: "Enter program input (optional)."

The program incorrectly echoes the user's input to the output.
