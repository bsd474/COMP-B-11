# Java - Project #2 Double Number

42.2 Programming Project #01B
Auto-graded programming assignments have numerous advantages, but have some challenges too. In order for auto-grading to work, sometimes the output needs to be formatted is a narrow and specific manner. For example, if you write a program to prompt the user to enter information as in the following, you do not need to output the 5.

- Enter x: 
- 5
- x doubled is: 10

The program should only output as follows:

- Enter x: 
- x doubled is: 10


Whitespace matters, an extra space can be a problem.

Be careful using print() vs. println().

For programs like this, be sure to use the input window to enter values. Look for the box that shows: "Enter program input (optional)."

The program incorrectly echoes the user's input to the output.

Try submitting it for grading (click "Submit mode", then "Submit for grading"). Notice that the test cases fail. The first test case's highlighting indicates that output 3 and newline were not expected. In the second test case, the -5 and newline were not expected.
Remove the code that echoes the user's input back to the output, and submit again. Now the test cases should all pass.
The 2 points you get when successfully completing this assignment will be recorded as 10 points in Canvas.
